Assignment 3
We plan to establish a system for retrieving climatological data in the public domain from the National Centers for Environmental Information (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/). The data archive (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/localclimatological-data/access/YYYY/) encompasses information gathered from over 13,400 stations spanning from 1901 to 2024. Each year, data is collected hourly at each station, covering parameters such as Altimeter, Dew Point Temperature, Dry Bulb Temperature, Precipitation, Present Weather Type, Pressure Change, Pressure Tendency, Relative Humidity, Sky Conditions, Sea Level Pressure, Station Pressure, Visibility, Wet Bulb Temperature, Wind Direction, Wind Gust Speed, Wind Speed, Sunrise, and Sunset readings. Our objective is to establish an additional pipeline to process this data and generate geographical maps depicting various parameters.
